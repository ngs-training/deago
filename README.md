# Module Template

This is an example repository for an individual module of a course and can be used as a template for creating new repositories for a course module.

The suggested layout is as follows:
- README.md : this file
- LICENSE : license file, currently set to CC-BY-4.0
- data : data required for the practical (suggest at this level to avoid unnecessary long path names)
- lecture : source file and final pdf for the module lecture
- practical : source files and final pdf for the practical exercises
- practical/Notebooks : if making the module available as a Jupyter notebook then the notebooks go in this directory 
- practical/Notebooks/index.ipynb : an example notebook for the course introduction
- practical/Notebooks/images : for any image files used in the notebooks
